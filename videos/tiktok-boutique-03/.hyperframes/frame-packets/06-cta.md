- blueprint: kinetic-type-beats (Adapt) + spring-pop-entrance + particle-burst
- focal: shop-now-button.jpg
- roles: shop-now-button.jpg = supporting (small accent, arrives late, echoes the button's own click cursor onto the real CTA button)
- asset_candidates: assets/shop-now-button.jpg — 3D shop-now button graphic with click cursor, CTA accent

- voiceover: "Besoin d'aide pour tout connecter ensemble ? Ecris OUTILS en message."

Adapt: same yellow bookend as Frame 1 for series continuity. This is the video's second-most-energetic beat: a confident spring-pop button landing, a particle-burst, and the shop-now cursor graphic sliding in to visually "click" the real CTA button a beat after it lands.

Scene 1 (0.0-1.6s): yellow canvas wash zoom-through-cuts in; the line "BESOIN D'AIDE POUR TOUT CONNECTER ENSEMBLE ?" fades up (2 lines, soft drift), centered top-half.
Scene 2 (1.6-2.3s): the button-primary spring-pops to center (scale 0.7->1.0, back.out(1.6) overshoot): "ECRIS 'OUTILS' EN MESSAGE"; a particle-burst (7-8 dots) fires from the button on landing.
Scene 3 (2.3-3.1s): `shop-now-button.jpg`'s cursor graphic (cropped to just the hand/cursor) slides in from bottom-right and settles pointing at the real CTA button, as if about to click it — a literal, playful echo of the reference image.
Scene 4 (3.1-6.0s): held final read - button, cursor accent, and question sit still (cursor keeps a very subtle sine-wave-loop micro-bob only); video ends on this frame.

## Selected motion rule: particle-burst

name: particle-burst
description: Deterministic particle / confetti events — a confetti pop that bursts up and drifts down (optionally instant-shrinking away), a dot burst from behind text, or a glyph dissolving to particles. Every particle's state is a pure ballistic function of timeline time from index-seeded values, so a scrub to any t shows the correct mid-flight frame.

# Particle Burst

Discrete flying particles as a one-shot event: a **confetti pop** that erupts upward and drifts back down on gravity, a **dot burst** radiating from behind a landing word, or a **glyph dissolve** where text breaks into particles that scatter and die. Particles are ephemeral garnish — born from a beat, fly, gone; they never become layout.

Boundaries: [css-marker-patterns.md](css-marker-patterns.md)'s burst mode is radiating **drawn lines** — a static accent, no flight. [press-release-spring.md](press-release-spring.md)'s release burst is **one blurred radial layer** faking an explosion — enough when a single glow pop will do. [center-outward-expansion.md](center-outward-expansion.md) moves **real layout elements** to final resting slots; particles have no destination, only physics and a death.

## How It Works

The whole event is **one driver tween and one formula**:

1. **Seeded setup** — a fixed pool of `PARTICLE_COUNT` small divs is created once at composition setup (a deterministic loop — setup-time generation is fine; per-frame DOM creation is not). Each particle `i` derives everything from a pure hash:

   ```js
   // angle, speed, size, spin, color (palette[i % palette.length]) — all from prand(i * k)
   const prand = (n) => {
     const x = Math.sin(n * 127.1 + 311.7) * 43758.5453;
     return x - Math.floor(x); // 0..1, pure function of n
   };
   ```

2. **Ballistic formula** — a proxy tween advances `T: 0 → 1` over `FLIGHT_DUR` with `ease: "none"`; `onUpdate` positions every particle as a **pure function of T**:

   ```
   x(T) = vx · T·FLIGHT_DUR
   y(T) = vy · T·FLIGHT_DUR + ½ · G · (T·FLIGHT_DUR)²
   rot(T) = spin · T·FLIGHT_DUR
   ```

   Gravity `G` supplies the rise-decelerate-fall arc for free. Because position is computed from `T` (never accumulated per frame), a seek to any moment renders the exact mid-flight state — this is what makes DOM particles seek-safe. The driver's `ease: "none"` is load-bearing: the physics lives in the formula; an eased driver warps gravity and the arc stops reading as thrown objects.

3. **Death** — an opacity tail inside the same formula (fade over the last `FADE_FRAC` of flight), or the confetti signature: a separate **instant-shrink** tween scaling the pool to 0 in a blink at flight end. Either way the particles end invisible and stay invisible.

## Recipe

<div class="burst-stage">
  <div class="particle-field" id="particle-field"></div>
  <div class="burst-hero" id="burst-hero">{heroWord}</div>
</div>
```

```css
/* .burst-stage: position: relative; display: grid; place-items: center.
   .burst-hero: z-index: 2 — particles fly BEHIND the word. */
.particle-field {
  position: absolute;
  z-index: 1;
  left: 50%;
  top: 50%; /* the launch origin — offset to taste (e.g. the word's baseline) */
  width: 0;
  height: 0;
}
.particle {
  position: absolute;
  left: 0;
  top: 0;
  border-radius: 2px; /* confetti chip; 50% for dots */
  opacity: 0; /* invisible until the event fires */
  will-change: transform, opacity;
}
```

```js
// Setup: deterministic pool, generated ONCE.
const field = document.getElementById("particle-field");
const palette = ["{accentA}", "{accentB}", "{accentC}"]; // 3-5 brand tokens
const parts = [];
for (let i = 0; i < PARTICLE_COUNT; i++) {
  const el = document.createElement("div");
  el.className = "particle";
  const size = SIZE_MIN + prand(i * 3 + 1) * (SIZE_MAX - SIZE_MIN);
  el.style.width = `${size}px`;
  el.style.height = `${size * 0.7}px`; // slightly oblong = confetti chip
  el.style.background = palette[i % palette.length];
  field.appendChild(el);
  // Index-seeded launch parameters — the particle's whole life, fixed here.
  const angle = -Math.PI / 2 + (prand(i * 5 + 2) * 2 - 1) * CONE; // upward cone
  const speed = SPEED_MIN + prand(i * 7 + 3) * (SPEED_MAX - SPEED_MIN);
  parts.push({
    el,
    vx: Math.cos(angle) * speed,
    vy: Math.sin(angle) * speed, // negative = up
    spin: (prand(i * 11 + 4) * 2 - 1) * SPIN_MAX,
  });
}

// Confetti pop — one driver, pure ballistic formula.
const drive = { T: 0 };
tl.fromTo(
  drive,
  { T: 0 },
  {
    T: 1,
    duration: FLIGHT_DUR,
    ease: "none", // physics lives in the formula, not the ease
    onUpdate: () => {
      const t = drive.T * FLIGHT_DUR; // seconds of flight — pure function of T
      const fade = Math.min(1, (1 - drive.T) / FADE_FRAC); // opacity tail
      parts.forEach((p) => {
        const x = p.vx * t;
        const y = p.vy * t + 0.5 * G * t * t; // rise, stall, drift down
        p.el.style.transform = `translate(${x}px, ${y}px) rotate(${p.spin * t}deg)`;
        p.el.style.opacity = String(drive.T === 0 ? 0 : fade); // T===0 guard covers seeks before the event
      });
    },
  },
  BURST_AT,
);
```

## Variations

- **Confetti pop, then instant-shrink** — the playful signature: full burst, gravity drift, then every chip scales to 0 in a blink: `FADE_FRAC` near 0, plus `tl.to(".particle", { scale: 0, duration: SHRINK_DUR, ease: "power2.in" }, BURST_AT + FLIGHT_DUR - SHRINK_DUR)` with `SHRINK_DUR` 0.15–0.25s. Keep the whole event tiny relative to the subject — a garnish measured in a few dozen pixels, not a screen-filling cannon.
- **Dot burst behind a landing word** — radial instead of a cone: `angle = prand(i) * Math.PI * 2`, `G` near 0, short flight (0.4–0.7s), round dots (`border-radius: 50%`), pool z-indexed behind the word. Fire at the word's settle frame.
- **Glyph dissolve** — seed each particle's **origin** across the glyph block's box (`ox = (prand(i*13) - 0.5) * BLOCK_W`, same for `oy`, added inside the transform), gentle outward drift with low `G`; text fades out over the first ~30% of flight while particles fade in from its silhouette. Color every particle `{textColor}` so the swarm reads as the text's own material. (True per-pixel dissolves are Canvas-2D territory — `techniques.md`; this DOM version sells it up to ~40 particles.)
- **Two-stage burst (pop + stragglers)** — split the pool: 70% on the main driver, 30% on a second driver ~0.12s later with lower speeds; the split is index-derived (`i % 10 < 3`). Same formula, two windows.

## Critical Constraints

- **Position is a pure function of time, driver ease `"none"`** — `x(T)`, `y(T)`, `rot(T)` computed from the driver value every frame, never accumulated (`+=`) per tick (accumulation breaks the moment the renderer seeks); gravity is the ease — an eased driver bends the parabola.
- **Fixed pool, no per-frame DOM** — all particles exist after setup with `opacity: 0`; the event only writes `transform` / `opacity`. **`PARTICLE_COUNT ≤ ~40`** — per-frame style writes scale linearly; keep the event cheap.
- **Particles start AND end at `opacity: 0`** — the `drive.T === 0` guard covers seeks to before the event; the tail/shrink covers after. A chip frozen mid-air at driver end is a bug every subsequent frame.
- **Particles are punctuation** — one event per beat, fired on a cause, small relative to the subject, dead before the next beat; z-ordered behind or around the word it celebrates, never over it. A persistent particle system is a background, and that's not this rule.

# Sine Wave Loop (subtle jitter / bounded ambient)

> **Reach for this last.** Per the motion doctrine (`references/motion-language.md`): circular breathing — scaling text/cards up and down to look "alive" — is cheap, the agent's reflexive cheat, and reads weak. "I'd rather have NO motion than BAD motion." First fill the back of a shot with **sequential reveal timed to the VO**; if a frame has genuinely settled and still needs life, the **sanctioned move is subtle jitter** — this rule at the LOW end of its amplitude range. A full breathing loop is the rare last resort on a single held hero, never stamped on every element.

Keeps a settled element from feeling dead using `Math.sin` on the timeline clock. Two forms:

- **Yoyo form** — one `sine.inOut` tween with `yoyo: true` and a **finite** `repeat` count. Preferred when the idle stands alone on a property nothing else touches.
- **onUpdate form** — one long `ease: "none"` tween drives a `phase` proxy `0 → 2π·CYCLES`; `onUpdate` maps `Math.sin(phase)` into the transform. Required when the offset multiplies/adds onto another live value (compound transforms, amplitude envelopes, multi-octave).

Either way, idle begins where the entry settled: at `phase = 0`, `sin(0) = 0` — the offset is zero, so there is no jump from the entry's resting state.

## Recipe

```js
// onUpdate form — phase-driven, composable.
const phase = { p: 0 };
tl.to(
  phase,
  {
    p: Math.PI * 2 * CYCLES,
    duration: IDLE_DUR,
    ease: "none", // sine provides the easing; a non-linear phase tween distorts the wave
    onUpdate: () => {
      const s = Math.sin(phase.p);
      hero.style.transform = `translateY(${s * Y_AMP_PX}px) scale(${1 + s * SCALE_AMP})`;
      // secondary elements: offset by Math.PI / 2 — synced motion looks mechanical
      dot.style.transform = `scale(${1 + Math.sin(phase.p + Math.PI / 2) * DOT_SCALE_AMP})`;
    },
  },
  IDLE_START_TIME,
);

// Yoyo form — standalone property, finite repeats.
tl.to(
  "#badge",
  { y: -Y_AMP_PX, duration: PERIOD / 2, ease: "sine.inOut", yoyo: true, repeat: REPEATS },
  IDLE_START_TIME,
);
```

## Variations

- **Multi-octave** (organic): stack a higher-frequency overlay — `1 + Math.sin(p) * AMP_PRIMARY + Math.sin(p * OCTAVE_RATIO) * AMP_SECONDARY`, with `AMP_SECONDARY < AMP_PRIMARY` and the combined max inside the normal SCALE_AMP range.
- **Settle and fade** (strongly recommended when `IDLE_DUR > 6s`): ramp amplitude to zero over the last ~20% of idle so the scene visibly settles before the inter-scene transition, instead of handing off mid-drift:

```js
const t = phase.p / (Math.PI * 2 * CYCLES); // 0 → 1 across idle
const env = t < 1 - FADE_FRAC ? 1 : (1 - t) / FADE_FRAC; // FADE_FRAC ≈ 0.2
const scale = 1 + Math.sin(phase.p) * SCALE_AMP * env;
```

This is the single biggest fix when finalize snapshots show "everything's still moving at the end"; it pairs naturally with break-boundary transitions (the outgoing visual is static when the crossfade/push begins).

## Critical Constraints

- **Prefer reveal, then jitter, then breath** — the doctrine order above; default to the LOW end of every amplitude range. At the upper end across 5+ consecutive scenes the whole film reads as "shimmering".
- **Long idle window** (`IDLE_DUR > 6s` OR idle > 30% of composition): halve `SCALE_AMP` / `Y_AMP_PX`, slow the period to 3–4s, and add the settle-and-fade tail.
- **Concurrent idle on N elements** (columns, card grid, stat row): per-element amplitude ≤ default `/ √N`, AND stagger the periods (2.1s / 1.9s / 2.4s). Three columns at ±6px compound to ±18px of competing motion; three at ±2–3px read as one collective breath.
- **Compose, don't replace** — idle ADDS to the element's resting transform; never overwrite the entry's final translation.
- **Phase tween `ease: "none"`** — sine itself is the curve.
- **No CSS `@keyframes` for idle** — CSS animation runs on the browser's render clock, independent of the HF seek clock; a CSS-driven idle flickers/desyncs. Drive idle inside the timeline.

# Spring-Pop Entrance

> **Smooth beats bouncy.** This entrance defaults to a smooth long-tail settle — `power3.out` (or `expo.out` for a faster front) — that decelerates cleanly into the resting size with **no overshoot**. Bouncy `back.out` is the **#1 instant turn-off** in agent-made videos and is almost never executed well; it is a rare, explicitly-playful exception (consumer / fun brand), never the default. When unsure, settle smoothly.

THE entrance primitive: an element (or staggered group) arrives by springing from nothing — `scale: 0 → 1`, optional small `y` rise — and settles without bouncing. This is **arrival**, not reaction: distinct from [press-release-spring.md](press-release-spring.md) (a click/press → release feedback chain on an element that already rests on screen). Many blueprints used to borrow that rule to fake an entrance; reach for this instead.

## How It Works

One `fromTo` carries the whole arrival: from `{ scale: 0, opacity: 0 }` (explicit, so t=0 is correct under seek) to `{ scale: 1, opacity: 1, ease: "power3.out" }`. For a **group**, the same `fromTo` runs per element at `i * STAGGER`, capped so the group reads as one arriving beat. The `scale` grow is load-bearing; the `y` rise is garnish — drop everything else and it must still read as a clean entrance. Let the ease produce the settle: never hand-key a `scale: 1.1` mid-state (it double-bounces against the curve).

## Recipe

.pop-hero,
.pop-item {
  transform-origin: 50% 50%; /* in-place pop; move to the source point for the anchored variation */
  will-change: transform;
}
.pop-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  gap: GRID_GAP;
  place-items: center;
}
```

```js
// Single hero pop — smooth long-tail settle, no overshoot.
tl.fromTo(
  "#hero",
  { scale: 0, opacity: 0 },
  { scale: 1, opacity: 1, duration: POP_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
  ENTRY_AT,
);

// Staggered group pop — one arriving beat.
gsap.utils.toArray(".pop-item").forEach((el, i) => {
  tl.fromTo(
    el,
    { scale: 0, opacity: 0, y: Y_RISE },
    { scale: 1, opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: POP_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
    GROUP_ENTRY_AT + i * STAGGER,
  );
});
```

## Variations

- **Calm settle** (premium / enterprise): `power3.out`, no rotation, `Y_RISE` 0–12px — a weighted, confident landing for a hero wordmark or product shot.
- **Firm settle** (everyday default): `power3.out` or `expo.out` for a punchier front, `Y_RISE` ~24px — cards, icons, callouts.
- **Exact-physics settle**: when the settle IS the shot, swap the ease for `springEase({ response: 0.4 })` (critically damped) from `../adapters/gsap-easing-and-stagger.md` → Spring Eases; take `duration` from the helper.
- **Origin-anchored pop**: a callout growing out of a specific point (marker, pointer tip) sets `transform-origin` to that point (e.g. `0% 100%`) so `scale: 0 → 1` reads as "emerging from the source", not "inflating in place".
- **Pop into a held slot**: land the pop and hold still — no idle loop baked into the entrance. If the held frame genuinely needs life, hand off to [sine-wave-loop.md](sine-wave-loop.md) for subtle jitter on a separate later tween; prefer revealing the next element on its VO cue.
- **Bouncy pop (RARE — explicitly-playful only)**: swap the ease for `back.out(OVERSHOOT)` and optionally settle a small `rotation: ROT_FROM → 0` so elements look hand-placed. Only for a deliberately playful register — never product / enterprise / serious tone:

```js
tl.fromTo(
  el,
  { scale: 0, opacity: 0, rotation: ROT_FROM },
  { scale: 1, opacity: 1, rotation: 0, duration: POP_DUR, ease: `back.out(${OVERSHOOT})` },
  GROUP_ENTRY_AT + i * STAGGER,
);
```

Even here keep `OVERSHOOT ≤ ~2` — past that it reads as cartoon wobble. Better still: the baked spring at `dampingFraction: 0.6–0.7` (same adapters doc) gives ~5–10% overshoot that reads physical where `back.out` reads cartoon.

| token      | range                                     | notes                                                            |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| EASE       | `power3.out` default; `expo.out` punchier | `back.out(OVERSHOOT)` only in the playful variant                |
| POP_DUR    | 0.4–0.7s                                  | shorter = tight snap; hero must be visible by **t ≤ 0.5s**       |
| STAGGER    | 0.04–0.08s                                | `min(0.06, 0.5 / ITEM_COUNT)` — self-caps the window             |
| ITEM_COUNT | 3–9                                       | >9 makes the stagger vanish — switch to a wipe/sweep reveal      |
| Y_RISE     | 0–32px                                    | small; never large enough to read as a slide-up                  |
| ROT_FROM   | −10°–+10°                                 | playful variant only; alternate sign by index (`i % 2 ? 6 : -6`) |
| ENTRY_AT   | 0–0.4s                                    | a beat of quiet, but keep the subject landing by t ≤ 0.5s        |

## Critical Constraints

- Default ease `power3.out` (no overshoot); `back.out` only in the explicitly-playful variant, and there `OVERSHOOT ≤ ~2`.
- `ITEM_COUNT × STAGGER ≤ ~0.5s` — the group must land inside one beat.
- Entrances state the collapsed from-state in `fromTo` — never rely on a CSS-hidden start (it renders visible before the tween claims it under seek).
- `transform-origin: 50% 50%` for an in-place pop; the source point only for the anchored variation.
- This is a finite arrival — idle motion on a held element is a separate, later `sine-wave-loop` tween.
